# ♛ N-Queens Visualizer

An interactive visualizer for solving the classic **N-Queens Problem** using backtracking. Watch how the algorithm places queens and backtracks to find all valid configurations.

## 🚀 Features

- **👑 Visualize Queen Placement:** See queens placed and removed on the chessboard.
- **🔁 Step-by-Step Backtracking:** Follow how the algorithm tries positions and backtracks.
- **🎨 Clean, Responsive UI:** Simple design that works on any device.
- **🌙 Simple Dark Mode:** Toggle light/dark mode for better viewing[2].
- **⚙️ Adjustable Board Size:** Choose from 4×4 to 10×10.
- **🔄 Multiple Solutions:** Find and navigate through all valid solutions.

## 🧠 What is the N-Queens Problem?

Place **N** queens on an **N×N** chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.  
This means no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## 🔧 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/harshitzofficial/N-Queens-Visualize.git
   cd N-Queens-Visualize
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`** in your browser.

3. **Use the controls to:**
   - Set the board size
   - Start or pause the visualization
   - Reset the board
   - Navigate through all found solutions
   - Toggle dark mode

## 💡 How It Works

This project uses **recursive backtracking** to try placing queens row-by-row. If a valid position is found, it proceeds. If not, it backtracks and tries a new position.

You can explore the source code in `script.js` to learn how backtracking algorithms work in real time.
